# Resources Table Setup - Verification Report

## ✅ Setup Complete

The resources database table has been fully configured and seeded with sample data.

---

## Table Structure

### Columns
- `id` (UUID, Primary Key) - Auto-generated
- `owner_id` (UUID, Foreign Key) - References profiles.id
- `title` (TEXT) - Minimum 3 characters
- `description` (TEXT) - Maximum 500 characters, nullable
- `url` (TEXT) - Must start with http:// or https://
- `type` (TEXT) - Must be 'video', 'article', or 'pdf'
- `created_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ) - Auto-set to current timestamp

### Constraints ✅
- ✅ Title minimum length: 3 characters
- ✅ Description maximum length: 500 characters
- ✅ URL format validation: `^https?://`
- ✅ Type enum: ['video', 'article', 'pdf']
- ✅ Foreign key: owner_id → profiles.id with CASCADE delete

---

## Row Level Security (RLS) ✅

RLS is **enabled** on the resources table with the following policies:

### 1. SELECT Policy: "Resources are viewable by everyone"
- **Operation**: SELECT
- **Role**: public
- **Effect**: Anyone can view all resources (public read access)

### 2. INSERT Policy: "Authenticated users can create resources"
- **Operation**: INSERT
- **Role**: authenticated
- **Effect**: Only authenticated users can create resources, and they must be the owner

### 3. DELETE Policy: "Users can delete their own resources"
- **Operation**: DELETE
- **Role**: public
- **Effect**: Users can only delete resources where owner_id matches their auth.uid()

---

## Performance Indexes ✅

Five indexes created for optimal query performance:

1. **resources_pkey** - Primary key index on `id`
2. **idx_resources_owner_id** - B-tree index for filtering by owner
3. **idx_resources_type** - B-tree index for filtering by resource type
4. **idx_resources_created_at** - B-tree index (DESC) for sorting by date
5. **idx_resources_search** - GIN index for full-text search on title + description

---

## Seed Data ✅

## Migration Documentation ✅

Created migration file at: `scripts/migrations/create_resources_table.sql`

This file documents the complete table setup including:
- Table creation DDL
- All constraints and checks
- Performance indexes
- RLS policies
- Verification queries

---

## Security Advisories

No critical security issues detected for the resources table.

Note: One unrelated warning exists about Auth leaked password protection (not related to resources table setup).

---

## Next Steps

The resources table is now ready for use. You can:

1. **View resources**: Visit `/resources` to see the seeded data
2. **Dashboard**: Visit `/dashboard` to see user-specific resources and stats
3. **Create resources**: Use the submit form (Milestone 4) to add new resources
4. **Test RLS**: Verify that users can only delete their own resources

## Verification Commands

```sql
-- Count resources by type
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE type = 'video') as videos,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE type = 'article') as articles,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE type = 'pdf') as pdfs
FROM public.resources;

-- View all resources
SELECT id, title, type, created_at 
FROM public.resources 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check RLS policies
SELECT policyname, cmd, roles 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'resources';
```
